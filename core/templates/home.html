                    <h2>Understanding Voltage</h2>

                    <p>
                        Voltage, the fundamental concept of electrical potential difference, serves as the impetus behind the flow of electrical current, driving the intricate machinery of our modern world. In this chapter, we delve into the essence of voltage, unraveling its intricacies and exploring its profound significance in electrical systems.

                            <h4>What is Voltage?</h4>
                            <p>At its essence, voltage represents the potential energy per unit charge between two points in an electrical circuit. Analogous to the pressure difference in a water pipe that drives the flow of water, voltage acts as the driving force that propels electrons through conductive materials. This electrical potential difference arises from the redistribution of charges within a system, creating an imbalance that seeks equilibrium through the flow of current.</p>

                            <p>Voltage is quantified in volts (V), named in honor of Italian physicist Alessandro Volta, whose pioneering work laid the foundation for modern electrotechnics. One volt is defined as the potential difference required to impart one joule of energy to a unit of electric charge (one coulomb). Additionally, voltage can be expressed in millivolts (mV) or kilovolts (kV), depending on the scale of the electrical system under consideration.</p>
